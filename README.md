# gcemod

Generalized competing event (GCE) modeling of **omega+** --- the ratio of the
hazard for an event of interest to the hazard for a competing event --- on the
cause-specific (Cox) and subdistribution (Fine-Gray) scales, with confidence
intervals and p-values from the Lunn-McNeil stacked-data approach.

## What it does

1. **Estimate covariate effects on omega+** for Cox and Fine-Gray models, with
   95% CIs, Wald p-values, and an omnibus test from the Lunn-McNeil stacked-data
   approach (`gcecox()`, `gcefg()`, `lunnmcneil()`).
2. **Build a risk score** from the model linear predictor (`$riskscore`).
3. **Find cutpoints** that maximize the omega+ difference between groups
   (`gce_cutpoints(method = "optimal")`).
4. **Alligator plots** --- cumulative incidence of the event of interest and the
   competing event within risk groups (`gce_alligator()`).
5. **Calibration plots** --- predicted vs. observed omega+ by rank, with a
   user-specified number of groups (`gce_calibration()`).

Per-subject omega = omega+/(1+omega+) is kept as a descriptive quantity
(`$omega`) so model-predicted values can be compared with observed ones.
Discrimination is available via `gce_performance()` (cause-specific C-index).

## Install and check (from source)

```r
# one time: create the demo dataset
source("data-raw/make_sample.R")      # writes data/hn.rda and data/prostate.rda

# regenerate man/ and NAMESPACE from the roxygen headers (REQUIRED for this
# release: the shipped source has no man/ directory)
devtools::document()

devtools::check()
```

## Quick start

```r
library(gcemod)
data(hn)   # head-and-neck cohort: status 1 = recurrence, 2 = death w/o recurrence
Ind <- data.frame(event     = as.integer(hn$status == 1),
                  competing = as.integer(hn$status == 2))
Cov <- hn[, c("age", "smoker", "t_cat", "n_cat", "p16")]

fit  <- gcecox(hn$time, Ind, Cov, M = 5, t = 5)   # or gcefg(...)
summary(fit)

cuts <- gce_cutpoints(fit, groups = 3, method = "optimal")
gce_alligator(fit, groups = cuts)
gce_calibration(fit, which = "omegaplus", groups = 5)
```
